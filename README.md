# Max_Temprature

maximum temperature calculation using mapreduce A MapReduce program to process a dataset with multiple temperatures for a year. You need to process the dataset to find out the maximum temperature for each year in the dataset.

Problem Explanation: In this data set, the first field represents the year and the second field represents the temperature in that year. As the temperature will not be constant throughout the year, each year has multiple temperatures listed in the dataset. You need to process the dataset and find the maximum temperature during a year. Here is the sample output:

Sample Output
1900 36
1901 48
1902 49

Our task is to process the ‘temperature’ records using MapReduce program and find out the maximum temperature during each year in this dataset.
